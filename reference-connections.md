# Connection Architecture
{: #connection-architecture}

{{site.data.keyword.composeForRedis_full}} database connections are managed by 2 HAProxy portals. Each portal has 64 MB of memory. 

The two portals to allow for applications to maintain connectivity should one of the portals become unreachable. Failover at the client side is the responsibility of the application designer. Unless you are working with a driver that completely handles failover errors, take the following steps:

* Work with a driver that accepts multiple endpoints in its connection configuration.
* Ensure your applications calls to read or write to the database react to errors appropriately. Options include:
  + Logging the error and reconnecting.
  + Reconnecting and retrying the operation that caused the error.
  + Queuing the failed operation and scheduling reconnection.

## Encryption in Transit

At provision, you have the option of enabling TLS/SSL backed by a Let's Encrypt certificate on your {{site.data.keyword.composeForRedis}} HAProxy portals. TLS/SSL encryption is not native to Redis. Most drivers can handle encrypted connections, but the redis-cli and some drivers do not without extra configuration. Whether you enable TLS/SSL depends on your specific use case. For more information, see the [Connecting an external application](/docs/ComposeForRedis?topic=compose-for-redis-external-app) page.

## Connection Limits

Database connections have a connection limit of 4096 connections per portal. Exceeding the connection limit makes your service unresponsive. You can manage connections from your application through your driver's connection pooling feature.

## Proxy Timeouts

The HAProxy portals manage the lifecycle of connections between the server and client. We detail them here as a reference for driver writers and others who have an interest in the low-level activity of {{site.data.keyword.composeForRedis}} database connections.

Setting | Value | Applies
----------|-----------|-----------
`client` | 5 m | When the client is expect to acknowledge or send data.
`connect` | 4 s | When a connection is being made between the proxy and the server.
`server` | 5 m | When the server is expected to acknowledge or send data.
`tunnel` | 1 d | When a bidirectional connection is established between a client and a server, and the connection remains inactive in both directions.
`client-fin` | 1 h | When the client is expected to acknowledge or send data while one direction is already shut down.
`check` | 5 s | As a secondary timeout check when a connection is being made between the proxy and the server.
